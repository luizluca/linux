Realtek MDIO-based Switches
==========================

Realtek MDIO-based switches use MDIO protocol as opposed to Realtek
SMI-based switches. The realtek-mdio driver is an mdio driver and it must
be inserted inside an mdio node.

Required properties:

- compatible: must be exactly one of (same as realtek-smi):
      "realtek,rtl8365mb" (4+1 ports)
      "realtek,rtl8366"               (not supported yet)
      "realtek,rtl8366rb" (4+1 ports)
      "realtek,rtl8366s"  (4+1 ports) (not supported yet)
      "realtek,rtl8367"               (not supported yet)
      "realtek,rtl8367b"              (not supported yet)
      "realtek,rtl8367s"  (5+2 ports)
      "realtek,rtl8368s"  (8 port)    (not supported yet)
      "realtek,rtl8369"               (not supported yet)
      "realtek,rtl8370"   (8 port)    (not supported yet)

Required properties:
- reg: MDIO PHY ID to access the switch

Optional properties:
- realtek,disable-leds: if the LED drivers are not used in the
  hardware design this will disable them so they are not turned on
  and wasting power.

See net/dsa/dsa.txt for a list of additional required and optional properties
and subnodes of DSA switches.

Optional properties of dsa port:

- realtek,ext-int: defines the external interface number (0, 1, 2). By default, 1.

Examples:

An example for the RTL8367S:

&mdio0 {
	switch {
		compatible = "realtek,rtl8367s";
		reg = <29>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			reg = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				label = "lan4";
			};

			port@1 {
				reg = <1>;
				label = "lan3";
			};

			port@2 {
				reg = <2>;
				label = "lan2";
			};

			port@3 {
				reg = <3>;
				label = "lan1";
			};

			port@4 {
				reg = <4>;
				label = "wan";
			};

			port@7 {
				reg = <7>;
				ethernet = <&ethernet>;
				phy-mode = "rgmii";
				realtek,ext-int = <2>;
				tx-internal-delay-ps = <2000>;
				rx-internal-delay-ps = <0>;

				fixed-link {
					speed = <1000>;
					full-duplex;
				};
			};
		};
	};
};
