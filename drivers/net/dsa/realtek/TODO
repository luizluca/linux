STATS/MIB counters
==================

- rtl8365mb_mib_counter_read(): remove mib_lock and use regmap_nolock w/ mutex
  held instead; ditto in mib setup. remember mib counter reading is also table
  access, per what Kobe Wu told me, so it might interfere with other table
  lookup.
- consider moving mib stuff to separate file

FDB/MDB
=======

- add an API to look up by address
- make (de)serialization APIs public too
- investigate why sometimes fdb_add succeeds, but next_uc doesn't return it (seems related to VID=0 EFID=0)
