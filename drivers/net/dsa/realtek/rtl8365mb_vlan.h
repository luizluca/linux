/* VLAN configuration interface for the rtl8365mb switch family
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2022 Alvin Å ipraga <alsi@bang-olufsen.dk>
 *
 * VLAN configuration takes place in two separate domains of the switch: the
 * VLAN4k table and the VLAN membership configuration database. While the VLAN4k
 * table is exhaustive and can be fully populated with 4096 VLAN configurations,
 * the same does not hold for the VLAN membership configuration database, which
 * is limited to 32 entries.
 *
 * The switch will normally only use the VLAN4k table when making forwarding
 * decisions. The VLAN membership configuration database is a vestigial ASIC
 * design and is only used for a few specific features in the rtl8365mb
 * family. This means that the limit of 32 entries should not hinder us in
 * programming a huge number of VLANs into the switch.
 *
 * One necessary use of the VLAN membership configuration database is for the
 * programming of a port-based VLAN ID (PVID). The PVID is programmed on a
 * per-port basis via register field, which refers to a specific VLAN membership
 * configuration via an index 0~31. In order to maintain coherent behaviour on a
 * port with a PVID, it is necessary to keep the VLAN configuration synchronized
 * between the VLAN4k table and the VLAN membership configuration database.
 *
 * Since VLAN membership configs are a scarce resource, this interface offers a
 * common way of allocating and freeing such entries. It enables reference
 * counting and emplacement of such entries into a list. It is up to the rest of
 * the users in the driver to make proper use of this interface to prevent
 * exhaustion of the VLAN membership configuration database. For this reason, it
 * is only possible to set the entries via &struct rtl8365mb_vlanmc_entry.
 *
 * With some exceptions, the entries in both the VLAN4k table and the VLAN
 * membership configuration database offer the same configuration options. The
 * differences are as follows:
 *
 * 1. VLAN4k entries can specify whether to use Independent or Shared VLAN
 *    Learning (IVL or SVL respectively). VLAN membership config entries
 *    cannot. This underscores the fact that VLAN membership configs are not
 *    involved in the learning process of the ASIC.
 *
 * 2. VLAN membership config entries use an "enhanced VLAN ID" (efid), which has
 *    a range 0~8191 compared with the standard 0~4095 range of the VLAN4k
 *    table. This underscores the fact that VLAN membership configs can be used
 *    to group ports on a layer beyond the standard VLAN configuration, which
 *    may be useful for ACL rules which specify alternative forwarding
 *    decisions.
